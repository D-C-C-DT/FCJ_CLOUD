In the context of rapid digital transformation, consumer behavior is shifting towards prioritizing online shopping to save time and enhance personalized experiences. Building an online fashion retail system not only meets the demand for fast and convenient shopping but also helps expand the market for brands and designers.

The project **"Building an Online Fashion Website"** is implemented with the goal of creating a specialized e-commerce platform in the fashion sector, providing features such as product browsing, search, ordering, as well as product, order, and user management.

Notably, the project applies modern technologies such as:

-**ASP.NET MVC** as the framework for both backend and frontend development,

-**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for deploying the system on a cloud infrastructure,

-**AI** â€“ Artificial Intelligence to recommend products that match user preferences and fashion trends using **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** and the **Amazon Neptune ML service**.

Far beyond a basic web application, the system is designed with a focus on scalability, high security, and optimized performance when running on the cloud platform. This forms the foundation for deployment in real-world environments or potential commercialization in the future.
